# ProjectC

For Project C, I've completed Steps 1 through 5 completely, and have the groundworks of Step 6 down. The shell can take text entered by the user and execute system calls based on the user input, such as loading a text file and displaying the text. With the exception of 'exec' system calls, any invalid commands will result in an error message.
